# e-commerce-site-php-based

This is a comprehensive e-commerce website that I created for a web programming class that taught how to setup and use a LAMP stack based development environment.

LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (or Python). Linux provides the operating system layer on which all the other tools and environments exist on in order to faciltate the creation and hosting of a web application.
